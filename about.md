I'm from Watertown, MA (just outside of Boston), I studied at UChicago in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, IL and currently live in Munich, Germany.

As a Fulbright Research Scholar, I am working under [Dr. Lewis Chuang](https://lewischuang.com/) within [Albrecht Schmidt's](https://www.um.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/schmidt/index.html) [Human-Centered Ubiquitous Media](https://www.um.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) group. My project currently focuses on electrical muscle stimulation for rhythm learning.

In June of 2021, I completed my BS in Neuroscience with a minor in Media Arts and Design at UChicago, where I worked as a computational neuroscience research assistant at the [Bensmaia Lab](https://bensmaialab.github.io), investigating the role of skin mechanics in texture perception.

I served as Co-chair of [UChicago TechTeam](uchicagotechteam.com), a civic tech student organization. As Internal Projects Chair, I oversaw client, project leader, and member recruitment, as well as project operations. I've volunteered as a [Bluebonnet](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/) Tech Fellow on the Siegrist Campaign for Wisconsin State Assembly, managing voter file analytics and digital advertising, reaching thousands of key swing voters.

I also served as a Writer and Managing Editor at the UChicago Triple Helix's [Science in Society Review](https://thetriplehelix.uchicago.edu/sisr).

In the summer of 2019, I studied computational creativity as a College Summer Institute Scholar. At the end of the summer, I participated in a [research symposium](https://ccrf.uchicago.edu/2019-college-summer-institute-closing-symposium-proceedings-full-text) and gave talk about my paper, entitled 'From Mary to AARON: Can Computers Be Artists?'

I have some original indie rock songs out on Spotify as [Nick Sherry.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6390rs9KTBkuqLehOrrL28) Check 'em out!

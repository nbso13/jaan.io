These days, I'm working toward a BS in Neuroscience with a minor in Media Arts and Design at UChicago. I'm a research assistant at the [Bensmaia Lab at UChicago](https://bensmaialab.github.io), investigating the role of skin mechanics in texture perception.

I serve as Co-chair of [UChicago TechTeam](uchicagotechteam.com), a civic tech student organization. As Internal Projects Chair, I oversee client, project leader, and member recruitment, as well as project operations. I've volunteered as a [Bluebonnet](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/) Tech Fellow on the Siegrist Campaign for Wisconsin State Assembly, managing voter file analytics and digital advertising, reaching thousands of key swing voters.

In the future, I'm looking to learn more about Human Computer Interaction, Computational Social Studies, and Critical Data Studies. I'm fascinated by the social dimensions of technology.
